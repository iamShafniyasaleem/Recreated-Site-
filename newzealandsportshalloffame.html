<blockquote>
<mark>  I had always intended New Zealand Hall of Fame would be part of a series. It was a no-brainer that the next book would be a sport book. Librarians and judges had been asking for a few years - Where were the sport books? I aim to please ...

Once again, I had real difficulty choosing who should be in the book. I couldn't decide between Richie McCaw and Dan Carter so I asked friends, fans and family on Facebook who they wanted. You'll have to read the book to find out who. Some felt (rather vehemently) that I should have both but I was determined to have one sportsperson from many sports. That said ... I did end up with two entries for sailing; big boat and small boat. I also have two from rugby league but one also represented New Zealand in Union, Touch and Softball!!!

Some of the sports people are just starting out but have already won significant medals, some are at the peak of their career, and some have long-since retired. Whatever sport you enjoy, you're bound to find it represented.

Bruce Potter was not available to illustrate the book. When the publisher asked who I would recommend. I immediately thought of Marco Ivancic. He had illustrated an article I had written (for a Travel Writing paper) for Massey University's magazine. I later befriended him on Facebook and saw more of his artwork, he is exceptionally talented. Luckily he was available and his artwork surpassed our expectations.

We have an added extra in the book this time. Wave your smart-phone or device over each page and the q-code will take you directly to a website or video about the sport star. Isn't technology wonderful!</mark></blockquote>
