<h1 class="title text-center">Talks and Workshops</h1>
 
          <p>I would love to give an author talk at your school. You can book me to come to your school through
            <a href="http://www.bookcouncil.org.nz/education/programme_overview/writers_in_schools.htm" target="_blank" class="linkunderline" target="_blank">NZ Book Council</a>, <a  href="http://www.rosemarytisdall.com/#!author-workshops/c13i3" target="_blank" class="linkunderline">Getting Kids into Books speakers agency</a>, or <a  href="contact.html">contact me directly</a>
            if you have any questions. I am prepared to travel around the country but will need to charge for travel and
            accommodation expenses outside the greater Auckland area.</p>
		  <p>If you are a school in Australia and would like me to visit please contact 
		  	<a href="http://www.speakers-ink.com.au/" target="_blank">Speaker's Ink</a> and they'll 
		  	arrange my visit. I'm visiting Australia all the time and can add school visits onto each trip.</p>
          <p>I could visit your school from 9am to lunch time or better still for the whole day (author talk until
            lunchtime, then workshops until home time). If you book a full day of author talks/workshops I'll do a free
            talk to teachers during lunch time or after school, about incorporating non-fiction into the language and
            reading programme.</p>

<h2>What I bring to a school or library visit:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>My talks are <b>interactive</b>. Children will participate in a puppet performance and or a role play.
              They'll ask and answer questions and quizzes.</li>
            <li>I make my talks <b>inspirational</b> (targeting mostly 7-14 year old children). I also give tips on how
              to write stories and share my writing process.</li>
            <li>I'm <b>passionate</b> about books and writing and aim to pass that passion on to children.</li>
            <li>Many of my books <b>fit in with school curriculum subjects</b> and I can tailor my talks to fit in with
              a social studies or science topics.</li>
            <li>I have over 20 puppets, and made or bought props to go with most of my books.</li>
            <li>I always spend several hours before a talk preparing for it to tailor it to your needs.</li>
            <li>I have a Bachelor of Education degree, Diploma of Teaching, and a Graduate Diploma of Journalism
              Studies.</li>
            <li>I've taught Primary and Intermediate aged children in New Zealand schools for ten years.</li>
            <li>I’ve studied literature for many years and continue to do so. I've attended lectures, workshops,
              conferences with many of New Zealand and Australian's best authors, illustrators, and educational
              speakers.</li>
            <li>I’ve presented many talks and workshops since 2002. I write every day, have had over 60 books published.</li>
          </ul>

<br>
<hr>
<br>
 <p><b>I offer 1½ hour writing workshops on the following subjects:</b> </p>
          <ul  style="padding-left:5px;">
            <li>Creative Non-fiction writing</li>
            <li>Writing Biographies</li>
            <li>Plotting picture book stories</li>
            <li>Readers' Theatre Script Plays</li>
          </ul>
          <p><b>Plus four mini workshops with the maximum of 20 students for one hour during school or after school on
              the following:</b></p>
          <p> <i>Workshop One:</i> <b>Exciting Beginnings</b> (how to start your story in seven different ways)</p>
          <p><i>Workshop Two:</i> <b>Plot Fantastic</b> (how to structure a story)</p>
          <p><i>Workshop Three:</i> <b>Lively Language</b> (includes passive vs. active writing, show don't tell, using
            imagery)</p>
          <p><i>Workshop Four:</i> <b>The Finale</b> (includes peer editing, and satisfying endings)</p>
          <p>Afterwards, I'll critique the students' finished product and give them a certificate. <a  href="contact.html">For
              more information please email me.</a></p>
          <p><b>For Teachers</b> I offer talks on non-fiction in the Language and Reading Programme <a  href="contact.html">Email me for further information</a>. </p>
          <p>
            If you live outside the Auckland area – you will need to contact me directly. I am very happy to travel to your area but I will need to organise other school visits while I am in your town/city to make it cost
            effective. If you can pass the message to schools in your area that I am available (for a fee) – I would be most grateful.<br>
			<br>
            If the rate is not what you had budgeted for, can I suggest you charge your students a $2 gold coin to contribute towards it. Many schools have been doing this for a while for other speakers. Alternatively, you
            could ask a local business if they would like to sponsor it.<br>
            My talks are entertaining, educational and inspirational to children.</p>
          <br>

		  <h2>What you can do to make the school visit successful:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Prep the children before the visit that I'm coming. They can visit <a  href="http://mariagill.co.nz/"  target="_blank">my
                website</a>.</li>
            <li>You could print out a <a  href="pdf/MariaGillPoster_Mar2014.pdf"  target="_blank">poster</a> and do a
              display of my books in your classroom or your library.</li>
            <li>Children could prepare questions to ask me.</li>
            <li>Could the teachers/aides please forget their marking and relax and enjoy the talk.</li>
            <li>Could teachers please monitor their own classroom's behaviour. I'll leave discipline up to you as you
              know your children best and they know you. If a child is misbehaving I'd appreciate it if you removed
              them, as they will distract us.</li>
            <li>Could someone in your school please help me to set up my talk on your school projector. Every projector
              is different in every school. I can do the talk without a Powerpoint but I find visuals engage another
              sense and help children stay focussed.</li>
          </ul>
		  <br>
		  <hr>
		  <br>
          <p><b>What I'll need for the talk:</b> </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Projector and screen for PowerPoint.</li>
            <li>Trestle table – to put props on.</li>
            <li>Drink of water.</li>
            <li>Long cord to connect to laptop or iPad.</li>
            <li>Speakers.</li>
            <li>Microphone for talks to over 300 children.</li>
            <li>Children set up in usual lecture formation; facing a screen.</li>
          </ul>
		  <br>
		  
          <p>If I am visiting your school during Book Week I would be very happy to sell my books to you at a discounted
            rate so that you can sell those to students and make a profit from them. Please email me if you require more
            information. I can send you a book order form so that teachers and students can buy the books direct from me
            or you can buy them on <a  href="http://www.longwhitecloudbooks.com"  target="_blank">Long White Cloud
              Books</a>.<br>
            <br>
            Please do put the photographs on your website or newsletter, as parents love to see their children engaging
            in the talks. Could you please send me a copy of some of the photographs. I would love to put them on my
            Facebook site or website if I can get permission from the parents.<br>
            <br>
            I look forward to hearing from you.</p>

                should have you visit!"</i><br>
              Gerri Judkin </p>
            <br>
            <p><i>"We thoroughly enjoyed Maria Gill visiting Hebron Christ College. She gave an excellent presentation,
                engaging our students in the closer examination of non-fiction books, and giving them new ideas for
                their own writing and research. Since then we have made a poster of Maria and her books, which
                constantly reminds children of 'when the author came to visit.'"</i><br>
              Lois Huston, Hebron Christian College</p>
            <br>
            <p><i>"We appreciated Maria's presentation because the children, and the teachers, not only found her
                engaging and inspiring, but it was refreshing to gain an author's perspective of non-fiction writing."</i><br>
              Ann Parnell, Mangawhai Primary</p>
            <br>
            <p><i>"We had 93 children and 9 adults watch you for a whole hour - and ready to stay longer, too, if they
                didn't have to get back for other commitments. As I mentioned in my introduction, we have had very few
                opportunities for children's author visits to our library in the 3 years of my tenure here and it was a
                great pleasure to host you at this event."</i><br>
